            <h3>Beginning</h3>
            <p>At the beginning of the term I found the lessons to be very straightforward. I had some previous experience with using code editors so I did not have a lot of difficulty in that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I probably spent more time customising my Visual Studio Code theme.</p>

            <h3>Middle</h3>
              <p>Here is when the 2 week holiday has started. My progress on the website was none because a video game I was looking out for came out, resulting in me not starting to build the website project.</p>
              <br>
              <p>After having my share of the game, I started looking back over the lecture slides and started doing some self-learning using <b>The Odin Project</b> resource, which really focused on learning flexbox.</p>

          <div class="grid-item">
            <img src="../img/flexbox-zombies.jpg" alt="Flexbox Zombies browser game">
            <h3>End</h3>
            <p>I spent a couple days learning the in and outs of Flexbox, playing interactive games that teach it, like <b>Flexbox Zombies and Flexbox Frogger.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>This whole website was done in 2 days (16th and 17th April). I am not trying to show off, on the contrary - I left things until the very last moment which is totally not ideal.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ended up building the website using Flexbox, but it was quite difficult to avoid making a div soup.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I imagine my pieces of code look like spaghetti to a professional web developer.</p>
