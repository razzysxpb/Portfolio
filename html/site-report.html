            It's tough. Learning website development is not as easy as it
            sounds, you need to put in time and effort if you want to get
            half-decent. Looking at a blank browser window that awaits to be
            converted into an end product using HTML, CSS and JavaScript can
            give you some anxiety, or at least in my personal opinion.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have enjoyed my time learning HTML and CSS while in lectures,
            while also trying to supplement this learning using other free
            resources too. I ended up learning more Flexbox than grid because
            that was the focus of the resources I had. And while I did learn
            Flexbox, honestly I still find it scary to try and style a web page
            if you don't keep on practicing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you are wondering why the commits are so close to each other on
            GitHub, that is because I created local copies of my project files
            and managed to mix my folder structure, having to recreate the
            repository in the short span of time and upload my files and commit
            one by one. They were all uploaded on the same day, but on different
            intervals (as soon as I finished the respective pages and their
            styling).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Also Linux and Firefox are awesome!</p>

        <div class="grid-item">
          <h3>Module Experience</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our teacher is very friendly and interactive, practicing the tried
            and true method of tell-show-do. That alone honestly makes lectures
            so much more understandable and fun.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The first few weeks of learning Web Development were great, got
            started with setting up Visual Studio Code on our laptops, learning
            about the essential HTML tags, doing some CSS styling. I am
            personally using a MacBook because of the hardware and battery life,
            but MacOS does get me confused at times. I do need to put some time
            in to learn it as my folder structure while practicing exercises was
            a complete mess.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
          <h3>Technical and Design choices</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Because of learning Flexbox better, I had difficulty in trying to
            make the complete website using grid. I have asked one of my friends
            of what a nice layout would be for a website, that being a simple
            header at the top with a navigation bar, 1-2 sections depending on
            the content and a footer. This was the end result, which I am
            honestly pretty happy with, despite being so simple. I would have
            struggled a lot more making the same layout using grid, but I do
            look forward to learning more.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the <b>header</b> I have decided to put a profile picture on
            top-left, a navigation bar on top right. I added CSS style for the
            links so they highlight the page you're currently on. Below the
            navigation bar is the title of the website, centered and in big
            font.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have then used the <b>section</b> HTML tag to create different
            sections for my website. I tried to avoid the div soup. Some
            elements like <b>main</b> had extremely little use, and
            <b>aside</b> is not even present, due to me not using grid from
            start to finish.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Some pages like the blog have got an ease-in effect when you hover
            with the mouse, I just thought it looked fancy. Same behaviour is
            present on the navigation bar links.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Footer</b> is a flex container with only centered text inside. I
            could have been fancy and put FontAwesome icons for social media but
            I thought that it would be too troublesome.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you inspect my CSS files you will notice there's many units, such
            as <b>fr</b>, <b>em</b> and <b>px. </b>Reason is, I found it
            difficult to estimate how much an em was, and I knew that pixels can
            pose problematic on smaller screens. fr was told to me by a
            classmate who's way more better at making websites. fr stands for
            fraction, and can me used to measure the grids much more precisely.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Colour choices</b> were just what I found to be simple and eye
            pleasing. A simple dark blue (Daintree #021f26) and slightly lighter
            gray (Zappy Zebra #eff1f1) I found on a colour palette website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Mobile layout</b> is something I completely omitted. Because of
            using Flexbox I assumed the website would be responsive enough,
            however that is not the case. When inspecting the page and choosing
            a mobile layout, the articles and images are squashed. I'm going to
            be honest, I do not know precisely how to fix this. Flexbox and
            mobile layout is something I need to work on.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There is also a lack of comments throughout my code. Reason is
            because I was too lazy to put them in and only decided to comment
            sections where I was testing styling in CSS to see what the property
            was doing and if I needed it. I do know commenting is a must and is
            something I plan to do more in the future.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Visual Studio Code extensions</b> I have used were
            <b>Live Server</b> for seeing my changes in real-time and
            <b>Prettier</b> for better code formatting.
