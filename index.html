        <p> Some info about me. My name is Razvan Avram (usually go by Raz) and I have come to live in the UK nearly 8 years ago. I'm quite enjoying my time here, except the weather - that's one thing I really miss as someone who used to live in Europe.

        <p>Currently studying Computing (Year 1) at University of Northampton.</p>
        <p>Hobbies of mine include:

                <p><b>Elden Ring</b> is currently one of my favorite games. It is in the same genre as Dark Souls series.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The reason I'm enjoying it so much is because this game has a lot of variety and I absolutely love roleplaying games and fantasy scenes. You can be using a strength or dexterity build, be a wizard or a priest with cool spells.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The game also features Player vs Player (PvP) action.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <p><b>Black Clover</b> is among my top choices when it comes to entertainment. It is a manga series which also got an anime adaption. The world is set in the medieval era and every person has a unique magic attribute and different spells.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Our main character has not been blessed with mana, however he has developed a thing called anti-magic, which is technically the antithesis of magic. Using his power and wits he has to outdo everyone who's been blessed from the start.</p>
                <br>
                <p>His tagline is <b>"My magic is never giving up"</b>.</p>
